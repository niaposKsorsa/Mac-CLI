# HAREM SCAREM: The Canadian Rock Band That Made a Splash in 1991
 
HAREM SCAREM is a Canadian hard rock band that formed in 1987 and released their self-titled debut album in 1991. The album was a success in Canada and Japan, where it spawned several hit singles such as "Slowly Slipping Away", "Honestly" and "Love Reaction". The band's style was influenced by bands like Journey, Def Leppard and Bon Jovi, but with a heavier edge and more melodic vocals.

The album was also notable for being one of the first to be released in FLAC format, which stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. This is a type of audio compression that preserves the original quality of the sound without any loss of data. FLAC files are larger than MP3 files, but they offer better sound quality and compatibility with various devices and platforms. FLAC files can also be converted to other formats without any degradation.
 
HAREM SCAREM's debut album was requested by a user on SoundCloud, who wanted to listen to it in its original FLAC format. The user shared a link to download the album from a blogspot site, where it was uploaded by another user. The album has been praised by other users on SoundCloud, who commented on its catchy songs, powerful vocals and impressive production. Some users also expressed their nostalgia for the band and the 1990s rock scene.
 
HAREM SCAREM went on to release 13 more studio albums, as well as several live albums, compilations and DVDs. The band has undergone several lineup changes over the years, but the core members have remained vocalist Harry Hess and guitarist Pete Lesperance. The band is still active today, and their latest album Change the World was released in 2020.
  
In 1995, HAREM SCAREM released their third album, Voice of Reason, which marked a departure from their previous melodic rock sound to a more alternative and grunge-influenced style. The album was not well received by fans and critics, and it failed to chart in Canada. The band also changed their name to Rubber in Canada, due to legal issues with another band using the same name. However, they continued to use HAREM SCAREM for their international releases.
 
The band returned to their melodic roots with their fourth album, Karma Cleansing (released as Believe in Japan) in 1997. The album featured a more polished and mature sound, and it was well received by fans and critics. The album also featured a new bassist, Barry Donaghy, who replaced Gionet. The band followed up with Big Bang Theory in 1998, which was similar in style to Karma Cleansing. The album also included a cover of Abba's "S.O.S.", which became a hit single in Japan.
 
In 2000, HAREM SCAREM released Rubber, their second album under that name in Canada (and fifth under HAREM SCAREM elsewhere). The album was a return to their heavier and edgier sound of Voice of Reason, but with more modern and pop elements. The album also featured drummer Creighton Doane, who replaced Smith. Smith remained as a backup vocalist and occasional guitarist for the band. The band released two more albums under the Rubber name in Canada: Ultra Feel in 2002 and Weight of the World in 2003 (the latter was also released as Higher under HAREM SCAREM elsewhere).
